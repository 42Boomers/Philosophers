# Philosophers
Complex project that uses mutex and forks in C.
There are a number of philosophers around a table, and they want to eat pasta. However, they only know how to eat with two forks and they have only one fork each. So they have to lend them to each other.
There is a time to eat, to sleep and to think.

The goal here is to use mutexes to lock the forks so that everyone starts eating as soon as a fork is released.

Time management is crucial, if they don't eat on time, they will die. So there should be no gaps between each service.
